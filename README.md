# BigRobit
A bigger; better version of the Robit

## Hardware
The hardware is inspired by [this Hackaday post](https://hackaday.com/2021/05/03/hoverboard-turned-heavy-duty-remote-control-rover/)

Using 4 "hoverboard" motors salvaged from faulty "hoverboards" provides relatively powerful brushless motors with sensors for a reasonable price while also recycling. 

4 custom designed motor drivers are used to power the individual motors

A controller board sends commands over CANbus to the motor drivers and coordinates their efforts
